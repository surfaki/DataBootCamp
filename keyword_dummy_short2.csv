Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost.

GREAT for company because it is so easy and yet taste wonderful! I cook this in the microwave, but I'm sure you could do it on the stove too. Times are what work in my microwave. Please use your own good judgment on times to use in your microwave. (In my quest to eat healthier, I now make it with light butter, light cream and reduced fat Parmesan cheese. It still tastes wonderful, but there isn't any guilt!)
PLEASE NOTE! This is an &quot;authentic&quot; Alfredo sauce recipe! Real Alfredo sauce *only* contains butter, cream, Parmesan cheese and pepper. It will be thin and there is no garlic in it!

99,Chaat Masala,1530,Carole Reu,,PT25M,PT25M,1999-08-26T19:39:00Z,"Asafoetida, mango powder and black salt distinguish the chaat masala from other  masalas, giving the blend a sourness that makes it a welcome accompaniment to  fresh fruit and other snacks.    

&quot;Chaat&quot; refers to various snacks and to the North Indian cafes that serve them. 

Fresh fruit often is sprinkled with lime juice  and chaat masala.    

Black salt (which is actually a reddish gray), available at  Indian food stores, has a distinctive flavor that's quite different from sea salt or table salt.

This is a simple scalloped potato recipe.  Everyone has their own way of preparing them, and I guess some people will like it and some won't, but this method is very similar to the way I make them.  The original directions gave the crockpot cooking method as the preferred method, with oven baking as an option.  I have reversed this option, since I don't do much cooking in the crockpot.  I hate to leave any electric appliance on when no one is at home.","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/10/2/picKlg7Uh.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/10/2/picmDH8PY.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/10/2/picH4phGr.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/10/2/picEtXOFk.jpg"")",Potato,"c(""Cheese"", ""Vegetable"", ""Healthy"", ""Weeknight"", ""Oven"", ""< 4 Hours"")","c(""5"", ""1/4"", ""1 1/2"", ""1 1/2"", ""1/2"", NA, NA)","c(""potatoes"", ""flour"", ""half-and-half"", ""cheddar cheese"", ""parmesan cheese"", ""paprika"")",4.0,25.0,332.0,10.5,6.5,32.3,260.7,46.0,5.2,4.3,14.2,,,"c(""Layer potatoes, flour, milk, and salt and pepper (if desired) in a large casserole dish in several layers, then top with cheeses and paprika."", ""Bake at 350°F for 1 1/2 hours."", ""Optional crockpot method:  Spray crock pot with non-stick spray.

The Lemon Lovers Cookbook The Chicago Sun-Times  Peg Bailey has a passion for lemons.

Exotic  fare such as Aegean shrimp and  caviar mousse exist peacefully with all-American staples such as  carrot cake and lemon bars.

2496,Dark Chocolate Cake,1535,Marg CaymanDesigns,PT50M,PT10M,PT1H,1999-10-23T12:27:00Z,"While it takes slightly longer to prepare this recipe than a box mix, the resulting moist, delicious cake makes it VERY worth the little extra time. I consider this 'perfect' chocolate cake. This cake is excellent with  both with Recipe #261024 and Recipe #208959 (the dark flavor version). (I use Recipe #95416 when I'm decorating the cake.) I love how the leftovers are still moist even a day or two later. (I store my loosely covered with plastic wrap.)
My father adores this cake with Recipe #261024 on it. For his birthday, Father's Day etc. I make him cupcakes with the icing on them and individually wrap them. He keeps them in his freezer for when he wants &quot;a piece of cake&quot;. He claims they are as good as when they are fresh. 
(Even though it isn't where I got the recipe from so I can't vouch for it, reviewers have said it is the recipe on the Hershey's cocoa can. I would recommend using their Special Dark Cocoa if possible.)","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/96/WnJFBuTMQEj2PNZ1hLwg_batch23-7154.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/v1/img/feed/2496/ujrrQ86xQ8esU3YsXoyo_DarkChocCake.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/96/qg1ylT80TMGWTf1OrBAj_IMG_1461.JPG"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/96/Y9iikuBR2SyunbnXkWSm_IMG_20140814_145156.jpg"",
