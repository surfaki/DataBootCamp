# PyCity Schools Analysis
---

### Analysis
-  We looked at a record of 39170 students attending 15 schools split evenly between charter and District schools and observed that Charter schools perform much better than district schools on all topics despite of per student budget being higher at district schools, but perhaps due to the increased attendance in district schools
### Conclusions
- District schools have higher budget, per student cost and perform worse nevertheless perhaps due to the also high number of students
- Charter schools on the other hand have lower cost and number of students and perform better
- There are no cler correlations when looking explicitly at charter or district schools for any of the metrics. However there is a big gap/correlation when looking at charter vs district, however 2 blobs make a line, so wouldnt call it a correlation necessarilly
