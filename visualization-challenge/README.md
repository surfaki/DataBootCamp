### Analysis
- We run a drug test, on 250 subjects with initial tumor size of 45mm3, of 10 drugs. Capomulin and Ramicane showed measurable improvement in the tumor size, while the rest showed little or negligible impact on the tumor, which also increased in size during treatment
### Conclusions
- There are only two effective drug treatments that showed tumor reduction (Capomulin and Ramicane). Both had similar performance. All other drugs either had no impact or all performance the same and the tunor increased in size
- The average final tumor volume is linearly dependent to the weight of the mouse for effective drug treatments, over the weight range of the study (15-25g)
- No significant impact of the sex on treatment efficacy over a similar data sample between males and females
